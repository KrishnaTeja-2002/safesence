## 🤖 AI Technology Used

### Primary AI: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

**Why GPT-4o-mini?**
- ✅ **Fast**: Near-instant responses
- ✅ **Cost-effective**: ~$0.00015 per interaction
- ✅ **Intelligent**: Understands context and provides accurate answers
- ✅ **Reliable**: Production-ready with high uptime

**How It Works:**
1. User types a question in the chatbot
2. Message sent to `/api/chat` endpoint
3. API constructs conversation with system prompt
4. OpenAI API processes and generates response
5. Response streamed back to user

### Custom System Prompt

The AI has been trained with comprehensive knowledge about Safe Sense:

```
Safe Sense Application Context:
- Sensor monitoring for refrigeration systems
- Temperature & humidity tracking
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Team collaboration and sharing
- Multi-device support
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Viewer)
- Historical data and analytics
```

**Capabilities:**
- Understands all Safe Sense features
- Provides step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshoots common issues
- Explains statuses and terminology
- Guides users through setup processes

### Fallback Intelligence (No API Key Required!)

Even without an OpenAI API key, the chatbot remains functional using smart rule-based responses:

**Pattern Matching Topics:**
- Sensor management (add, remove, configure)
- Alert setup and configuration
- Team sharing and permissions
- Dashboard features
- History and analytics
- Account settings
- Troubleshooting
- Status meanings
- And more...

**Benefits:**
- Zero cost
- Instant responses
- Covers 90% of common questions
- Perfect for development/testing
- Graceful degradation if API fails

## 📊 Example Conversations

### Adding a Sensor
```
User: How do I add a new sensor?

AI: To add a new sensor:

1. Go to Devices page from the sidebar
2. Click the "Add Device" button
3. Enter your ESP32 device details:
   - Device Name (e.g., "Kitchen Fridge")
   - Device ID (from your ESP32)
   - Sensor Type (Temperature or Humidity)
4. Configure alert thresholds
5. Click "Add Device"

Your sensor will appear on the dashboard once it starts sending data!
```

### Understanding Alerts
```
User: What does the red status mean?

AI: Safe Sense Alerts System:

Alert Types:
🔴 Critical (Red): Immediate attention needed
🟡 Warning (Yellow): Approaching thresholds
🟢 OK (Green): Everything normal
⚫ Offline (Gray): Sensor not responding

Configure Alerts:
1. Go to Alerts page
2. Set your temperature thresholds (min/max)
3. Enable email notifications
4. Save your preferences

You'll receive instant notifications when readings go out of range!
```

### Troubleshooting
```
User: My sensor is offline, what should I do?

AI: Sensor showing offline? Try these steps:

1. Check Power: Ensure ESP32 device is powered on
2. WiFi Connection: Verify device is connected to WiFi
3. Signal Strength: Move device closer to router if needed
4. Device Status: Check LED indicators on ESP32
5. Recent Activity: View "Last Updated" time on dashboard

If offline for >5 minutes, check your device's network settings. 
Contact support if issue persists.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
User Interface (ChatBot.js)
        ↓
    Frontend State Management
        ↓
    API Request (/api/chat)
        ↓
    OpenAI Integration ← System Prompt + Context
        ↓
    AI Response Generation
        ↓
    Fallback System (if needed)
        ↓
    Response to User
```

### API Endpoint Details

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/chat`

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "How do I add a sensor?" }
  ]
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "To add a new sensor...",
  "fallback": false
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Catches OpenAI API failures
- Falls back to rule-based responses
- Returns user-friendly error messages
- Never breaks the chat experience

### State Management

**React Hooks Used:**
- `useState`: Message history, input state, loading state
- `useRef`: Scroll behavior, click-outside detection
- `useEffect`: Auto-scroll, event listeners
- `useDarkMode`: Theme integration

**State Structure:**
```javascript
messages: [
  { role: 'assistant', content: '...' },
  { role: 'user', content: '...' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: '...' }
]
```
